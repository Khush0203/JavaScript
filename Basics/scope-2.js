//let name = 'Andrew'

if(true){
    if(true){
        name = 'Mike'
        console.log(name)
    }//in this case since it does not find a variable it creates one!
}//Here it prints Mike

if(true){
    console.log(name)

}//Here it prints out Andrew


//You can declare vaiables with same name
//Here's the catch: It has to be in a different code block
